# Wave Energy Generation 
Data Mining Regression Project - Paula McCree-Bailey

### Overview of Project
#### Paula McCree-Bailey

The main goal of Project 3 is to work with a regression models. The goal is to create a blog that includes (1) an introduction to topic and dataset. Next, (2) discuss what regression is and how it works (specifically linear regression). Math for bonus points. Then, (3) discuss experiments with different types of regression. Lastly, (4) conclude with what you have learned from this project.

### **Introduction**

Fossil fuel can be a double-edged sword offering both positive and negative opportunities.  It can offer wealth to countries to fuel their economies and gasoline (plus byproducts) to offer mobility and comfort in the form of electricity for their citizens.  On the other hand, fossil fuel can be devastating to the environment if it is extracted incorrectly, and it is not an infinite resource.

A promising renewable energy resource is the use of wave farms to create energy.  The ocean covers 70% of the earth's surface.  It is also about 97% of all water on Earth.  The abundance of the oceans is a major reason to explore wave farming as an option for energy.

My project is based on the white paper [Optimisation of Large Wave Farms Using A Multi-Strategy Evolutionary Framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WPVM3WzIP5SFv4GOJZVT6KZOgOme0ALp/view?usp=drive_link). The primary goal of their "research is to maximise the total harnessed power of a large wave farm consisting of fully submerged three-tether wave energy converters (WECs)." Specifically, the study looked at wave farms in Perth and Sydney, Australia which contained over twenty convertors. The research included six modern algorithms, four discrete search techniques and three hybrid optimization methods.

This regression project focuses on research on the Perth 49 converter wave farm.

##### **Perth Wave Power Project**
Perth Wave Power Project is an offshore development in Western Australia that went live in February 2015. At that time, the energy generated was able to power 3,500 households.  It is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emission by more than 500,000t over the life of the project.

The wave converters use large buoys tied to the sea floor by a rope.  As the buoy rises and falls with each passing wave, the rope tightens causes high pressures.  These pressures are piped to shore where it powers water desalination plants and produces electricity.

The goal is to predict the total power output based on the coordination of the wave energy converters (WECs) within a large wave farm.  By demonstrating the benefits of wave energy maybe we can change a few minds to invest in wave energy.
